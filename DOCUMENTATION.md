## 🎨 Styling and Theming

### Bootstrap Integration

The website leverages **Bootstrap 5** for its responsive grid system and UI components. The Bootstrap base ensures consistency across different screen sizes and browsers.

### Custom CSS

Custom styling is applied via `custom.css` to extend Bootstrap and create a unique visual identity:

- Custom color scheme
- Typography adjustments
- Spacing and layout refinements
- Animations and transitions

### Dark/Light Mode Implementation

The website features a dynamic theme toggle with the following components:

1. **Theme Toggle Switch** - A switch in the navigation bar
2. **Theme Variables** - CSS variables for color schemes
3. **localStorage** - Persists user preference across sessions
4. **Theme Detection** - Respects system preferences by default

#### CSS Variables for Theming

```css
[data-bs-theme="light"] {
    --text-color: #333;
    --bg-color: #fff;
    --section-bg: #f8f9fa;
    --card-bg: #fff;
}

[data-bs-theme="dark"] {
    --text-color: #f8f9fa;
    --bg-color: #212529;
    --section-bg: #343a40;
    --card-bg: #2b3035;
}
```

#### JavaScript Theme Toggling

The theme toggle functionality is implemented in JavaScript, which:
- Checks for user's preferred color scheme
- Reads/writes to localStorage
- Toggles between themes
- Applies appropriate styles

## 📱 Responsive Design Approach

The website follows a responsive design approach:

1. **Mobile-First Design** - Base styles target mobile devices
2. **Breakpoints** - Styles adapt at key screen widths
3. **Fluid Grid** - Bootstrap's grid system for layout
4. **Responsive Typography** - Font sizes that scale with viewport
5. **Media Queries** - Additional adjustments for specific screen sizes

## 🔌 JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript (`main.js`) provides several interactive features:

1. **Smooth Scrolling** - For anchor links
2. **Progress Bar Animation** - For skill levels
3. **Theme Toggling** - For dark/light mode
4. **Tooltips** - For enhanced UI elements
5. **Mobile Navigation** - For responsive menu

## 🔧 Flask Application Logic

The Flask application (`app.py`) handles:

1. **Route Definitions** - URL paths and handlers
2. **Template Rendering** - With appropriate context data
3. **Static File Serving** - For CSS, JS, and other assets
4. **Active Page Tracking** - For navigation highlighting
